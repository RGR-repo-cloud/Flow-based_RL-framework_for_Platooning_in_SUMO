# Extension of Flow for Longitudinal Vehicle Platooning

Flow (https://github.com/flow-project/flow) is a framework for building RL-compatible environments for traffic microsimulators like SUMO (https://github.com/eclipse-sumo/sumo). In this repository a simple platooning environment is added for training and evaluating RL algorithms implemented in this repository: https://github.com/RGR-repo-cloud/RL-based_Longitudinal_Vehicle_Platooning_in_SUMO . 


## Setup Instructions
If you want to use this extension of Flow you need to rename it to "flow" after cloning.
